# smart-home
A model of smart home with multiple functions (ESP/Arduino implementation) is my project in the course IoT at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.
I worked on each module and then integrated them to a complete system.
I used Blynk for most applications and it worked perfectly.
Please give me a ‚≠ê if you find it useful.
